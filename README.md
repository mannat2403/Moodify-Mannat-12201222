"# üéß Moodify ‚Äì AI-Powered Emotion-Based Music Recommender"


Project Overview:-

Moodify is an AI-powered music recommendation web app that detects a user's mood using facial expressions or text input and curates a personalized playlist that matches their emotions ‚Äî whether happy, sad, energetic, or relaxed.
It blends emotion recognition, natural language processing, and music intelligence to enhance everyday listening experiences.


Problem Statement:-

People often struggle to find music that fits their current mood ‚Äî scrolling endlessly through playlists or skipping songs that don‚Äôt match their feelings.
Moodify solves this by automatically detecting your emotional state and recommending songs that resonate with your mood in real time.
Example:
‚ÄúUsers spend too much time choosing songs. Moodify uses facial emotion detection or sentiment analysis to instantly generate mood-based playlists.‚Äù


Solution Summary:-

Moodify uses a webcam or text-based emotion detector powered by AI to analyze a user's emotions.
Once the mood is detected, the system fetches curated songs from Spotify or a custom playlist that matches the user's emotion.
The app provides an intuitive interface where users can see their detected mood, explore playlists, and toggle between ‚Äúauto‚Äù and ‚Äúmanual‚Äù modes.
Example Flow:
1. User enables camera or types a sentence.
2. AI model detects emotion (e.g., Happy, Sad, Angry, Calm).
3. App fetches songs related to that mood using an API or predefined dataset.
4. Playlist appears instantly with smooth UI transitions.
